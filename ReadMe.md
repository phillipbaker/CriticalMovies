# Critical Movies

An iOS app that displays New York Times movie reviews. 

The first tab shows recent Critics’ Picks reviews and the second tab enables users to search all New York Times movie reviews.  

It’s built with **UIKit**, **UICollectionView**, and **Auto Layout** in code. It features infinite scroll, cell reuse, search, error handling, and unit tests.
